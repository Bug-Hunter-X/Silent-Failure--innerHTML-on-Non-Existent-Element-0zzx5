This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML involving the use of `innerHTML` on an element that does not yet exist in the DOM. The code attempts to modify the content of an element with the id 'myDiv2', however, this element is not defined in the HTML.  This leads to a silent failure â€“ the script executes without errors, but the intended changes are not reflected on the page.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly use `innerHTML` after ensuring the target element exists.
